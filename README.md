# NFLDraftWikiHits

#### This project explores 

## Overview
#### The following is a rough outline of the material covered in this project:
#### - scrape data from pro-football-reference.com
#### - collect wikipedia page views for each player
#### - prepare data for analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
#### - conduct ancova measurement to test for significant changes in Wikipedia page views

## Results
#### - all drafted players see a 7x increase in Wiki hits in the week following the draft
#### - first round draft picks see an additional boost of 3,000 views per day for the week after the draft
#### - there is no clear difference in results for draft picks between rounds 2 and 7 outside of the 7x boost
